#spread
spread is based on theano.
  
The project name is made up of the acronym of Softmax, Pooling, RNN, Embedding, Attention, Dense or Dropout.
  
This project includes some components of neural networks, such as LSTM, CNN, Dense, etc. We can use them to build a model rapidly. 
  
When building a model, you just need to finish the defining of data flowing. There is an example, which uses LSTM and Attention to classify the question sentence. 
  
In this project, the style of layer is specified. So, it's easy to read all the codes. What's more, you can use the superclass to write your own new layer much easier!
